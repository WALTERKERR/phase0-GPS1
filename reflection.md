**Joshua Monzon's Reflection**

#What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

This session was straight foward and easy for the most part. THe only issue we ran into was the conflict merge. 


#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

The concept of git fetch and git merge. I always used just git pull origin master to update my repository from git hub.  

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
 
 We used James (Guide) for refrences on a few commands and clarification on git merge and fetch. Walter (pair) was very helpful and definitly had a better grasp on the git workflow than me.
 
 
#What still confuses you about git?

I feel pretty confident using git, I just need more Practice with the git conflicts


#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My First GPS was very fun and benefitial! I need to learn to slow down when I navagate. I kept getting ahead of myself and it would actual slow us down. Walter was a very good driver and navigater. He was concise and informative.
